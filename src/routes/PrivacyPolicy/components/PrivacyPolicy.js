    <p>
        We collect your personal data typically when you register to the Website or
        the Playven Services, make a reservation or purchase services or products
        through the Website or the Playven Services, enter into a sales campaign,
        or otherwise interact with us. Below are some examples on the categories of
        personal data we collect on and from you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information provided by you. We may collect such personal data on you as
        your name, street address, e-mail address, phone number and other contact
        information that you provide us when you register to the Website or the
        Playven Services or make purchases through them. We may also collect
        payment information, such as your credit card information, for realization
        of online transactions you have made in our Website or the Playven
        Services. In addition to such contact and payment information, we may
        collect your user name, password and other credentials used to authenticate
        users, as well as information you upload to the Website or a related mobile
        application (such as location etc). We may also collect demographic data
        (such as your age, gender, interest and preferences) on you, which may
        include your personal data. When making a reservation or sending requests
        via the Website, if you submit information concerning other persons (e.g.
        on persons in your sports party), we may also process such personal data to
        the extent necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        For online payments and other transactions, we use a third party payment
        service provider Stripe Payments Eurpole Ltd. (“<strong>Stripe</strong>”).
        To enable Stripe to provide this online payment service, we collect and
        store certain identification data from superadmin users of the Website and
        Playven Services. This identification data may include such personal data
        as personal identification number and copy of a passport, which may be
        considered as sensitive data. We only use any such personal data collected
        in order to enable the Stripe online payment service, and always ensure
        sufficient security of such personal data. Processing of any of your
    personal data by Stripe is covered by the Stripe privacy policy (available <a href="https://stripe.com/fi/privacy">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Technical information and data obtained from third parties. When you visit
        the Website or otherwise use our related services, certain technical
        information is typically collected. Such technical information may include,
        for example, the third party website you linked from, you IP-address and
        used browser, content you viewed, ad-preferences, your device identifier
        and other equivalent technical information your browser provides us or that

    </p>
    <p>
        We may also obtain certain data containing personal data on you from third
        parties. This may be the case e.g. if a person making a reservation via our
        Website provides information of you for the reservation or sends you
        information from our Website or where you access our Website through a
        third party platform (such as through a social media link). In addition,
        where we act as a service provider or a partner to sports court managers,
        they may also provide us with your contact details and other personal
        information in order for us to enable the service. However, we will only
        use such personal information received to the extent necessary for us to
        perform the service requested. The third party, who disclosed your personal
        data to us, is responsible for and is the data controller in relation to
        such personal data.

        Third party platform integration and social media. Where the Website or
        related services permit you to interact with a third party platform or
        service, your personal data may be shared or be publicly displayed where
        you choose to “like” or “share” our content or post information from our
        Website or the Playven Services via e.g. a social media tool (such as a
        Facebook account link). If you choose to use such social media tool or
        other linked third party platform or service available on the Website or on
        the Playven Services, use of such features may allow us to collect
        information about you, including personal data. In addition, such third
        party service providers may also collect, process and use the personal data
        and other information you disclose when you choose to use the third party
        features. The information collected, processed and stored by such third
        parties via the third party platforms is subject to the third party’s
        privacy policies, wherefore you should acquaint yourself with the relevant
        third party privacy policy.
